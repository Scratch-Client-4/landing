      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <article>Itchy (referred to here as "THE APP") collects very little identifiable information about its users.  It is important to note exactly what data we store:<br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Scratch username</li>
        <li>Your temporary auth token</li>
        <li>Your app settings</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <b>All of these are stored offline, on your phone.</b>  The app tries to make as many web requests as possible directly from your phone, but there are a few technical limitations in certain situations that force them to go through our servers, hosted by Vercel, including: <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Logging in</li>
        <li>Following users</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Performing these tasks involves sending your username and password or your auth token to our servers.  They are not saved or logged.  Usage data of the app is not collected in any way that is identifiable of a certain user or group.  Any data that is collected is completely generic and non-tracable.
