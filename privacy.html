            <em>
              Itchy is a third-party mobile and web client for interacting with
              Scratch projects via TurboWarp, with features like mobile-friendly
              controls and MultiPlay (real-time collaboration). This Privacy
              Policy explains how Itchy handles your data and protects your
              privacy.
            </em>
          </p>

          <h2>1. Account Information</h2>
          <p>
            Itchy does <strong>not</strong> allow users to create Scratch
            accounts. All accounts must be created via
            <a
              href="https://scratch.mit.edu"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >scratch.mit.edu</a
            >. However, some Itchy features—like submitting mobile control
            schemes or joining MultiPlay sessions—require login with a Scratch
            account.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your Scratch username and password are stored
              <strong>only in your device's encrypted local storage</strong>
              .
            </li>
            <li>
              You can sign out at any time, which removes this data from your
              device.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Authentication and session tokens</strong> issued by
              Scratch are stored <strong>on your device</strong> in cookies to
              maintain login sessions. These tokens are never used for analytics
              or tracking and expire according to Scratch’s own rules.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. ControlsDB</h2>
          <p>
            <a
              href="https://itchy-controldb.vercel.app"
              rel="noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              >ControlsDB</a
            >
            is a community-powered database of user-submitted
            <strong>mobile control schemes</strong> for Scratch games. This
            allows players to interact with keyboard-based projects on
            touchscreen devices.
          </p>
          <p>When submitting a new control mapping to ControlsDB:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The app verifies that you are logged in to your Scratch account
              using your <strong>Scratch session token</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >No username, password, or personally identifying information is
                sent to or stored by ControlsDB.</strong
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              ControlsDB is operated by <strong>Micah Lindley</strong>, the lead
              developer of Itchy.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. TurboWarp Integration</h2>
          <p>
            Itchy embeds
            <a
              href="https://turbowarp.org"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >TurboWarp</a
            >
            inside a WebView to play Scratch projects. Additional JavaScript is
            injected to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide touchscreen keyboard controls.</li>
            <li>Enable MultiPlay peer-to-peer collaboration.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Any projects loaded or data sent through TurboWarp servers are
            governed by
            <strong
              ><a
                href="https://turbowarp.org/privacy.html"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                >TurboWarp’s own privacy policy</a
              ></strong
            >. Itchy does not modify TurboWarp’s storage or networking beyond UI
            integration and input simulation.
          </p>

          <h2>4. MultiPlay (WebRTC Communication)</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>MultiPlay</strong> allows users to collaborate in real-time
            by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Streaming the Scratch project canvas (via
              <code>canvas.captureStream</code>) from the host device—<strong
                >no camera or microphone access is used</strong
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Receiving control input (e.g., key presses) from remote clients
              via
              <strong>WebRTC</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>All MultiPlay communication is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Peer-to-peer and encrypted</strong>.</li>
            <li>
              Facilitated through a <strong>signaling server</strong> (run by
              Micah Lindley) that connects devices but does
              <strong>not store or log any communication</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            MultiPlay is
            <strong>restricted to users aged 13 and older</strong> in compliance
            with child privacy guidelines.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
          <p>Itchy uses on-device storage and cookies to store:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your <strong>Scratch authentication token</strong> for session
              management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your <strong>Scratch credentials</strong> (encrypted) for
              persistent login.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This data is <strong>not shared</strong>,
            <strong>not used for tracking</strong>, and is deleted upon logout
            or app uninstallation.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Comment Moderation and Community Interaction</h2>
          <p>
            Itchy does
            <strong
              >not host or moderate user comments or community content</strong
            >. All comment functionality is part of the official Scratch
            platform and is
            <strong>moderated solely by the Scratch Team</strong>. If you
            encounter inappropriate content or behavior in comments, please
            report it through
            <a
              href="https://scratch.mit.edu"

              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >scratch.mit.edu</a
            >.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Data Sharing and Retention</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              No WebRTC communication or authentication data is stored or shared
              externally.
            </li>
            <li>
              ControlDB submissions use only the Scratch session token at the
              time of submission.
            </li>
            <li>
              All local data (credentials, tokens) is stored only on your device
              and not synced to any cloud services.
            </li>
            <li>Tokens expire according to Scratch’s session policies.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Itchy is accessible to users under 13. However, to protect younger
            users:

            <li>
              <strong
                >MultiPlay is available only to users aged 13 and older</strong
              >.

              Parental guidance is encouraged when children use interactive
              features.
            </li>
          </ul>
