        <h1>MultiPlay FAQ</h1>
        <article>
          <h2 style="margin-top: 1rem">What is MultiPlay?</h2>
          <p>
            MultiPlay is a feature of the Itchy app that allows users to play
            local-multiplayer style Scratch games with friends in real-time. It
            uses WebRTC to connect devices over a peer-to-peer connection and
            stream the Scratch project from one device while sending control
            inputs from other devices.
          </p>

          <h2>Is MultiPlay secure?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, MultiPlay uses the WebRTC technology for peer-to-peer
            connections, which are encrypted by default. Additionally, the
            signaling server used to establish connections does not store or log
            any communication between devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sending control inputs does not actually emulate real keypress or
            mouse events on the host device, but instead injects inputs directly
            into the TurboWarp virtual machine running inside Itchy. This means
            that MultiPlay does not have access to your device or your personal
            data.
          </p>

          <h2>Can anyone use MultiPlay?</h2>
          <p>
            To comply with child privacy laws, MultiPlay is restricted to users
            aged 13 and older. This is to ensure that all participants can
            understand and consent to the real-time connection features.
          </p>

          <h2>I don't see the MultiPlay feature in my app</h2>
          <p>
            At present, MultiPlay is only available in the beta version of the
            Itchy app, which you can join at
            <a
              href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.scratchclient4.itchy"
              target="_blank"
              >this link</a
            >. You also may not see the MultiPlay feature if you are under 13
            years old, as MultiPlay is restricted to users aged 13 and older.
          </p>

          <h2>Does MultiPlay comply with the Scratch community guidelines?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, MultiPlay is designed to comply with Scratch's community
            guidelines. It does not allow sharing of personal information,
            inappropriate content, or any features that violate Scratch's terms
            of service. All interactions are limited to the context of the
            Scratch project being played, which is fully subject to moderation
            by the Scratch Team.
          </p>

          <h2>Why is my MultiPlay session not connecting?</h2>
          <p>
            MultiPlay uses WebRTC in STUN mode, which may require additional
            network configuration (e.g., firewall settings) to work properly. If
            you're having trouble connecting, please check your network settings
            or try using a different network. Many school or workplace networks
            may block WebRTC traffic by default, so you may encounter issues on
            those kinds of networks.
          </p>

          <h2>How do I communicate with other players?</h2>
          <p>
            Itchy does not provide built-in chat or voice communication features
            for MultiPlay in order to comply with the Scratch community
            guidelines. Itchy MultiPlay is designed to be primarily used by
            friends who are in the same physical location.
          </p>

          <h2>How many players are supported?</h2>
          <p>
            In the current beta stage, MultiPlay currently supports 2 players in
            a session. This limitation may be increased to 4 players in the
            future, depending on performance and user feedback.
          </p>

          <h2>______ isn't working, fix it</h2>
          <p>
            MultiPlay is still in beta, and we are actively working on improving
            the feature. Chances are, if you encounter a bug, we've already
            encountered it and are working on it. Don't expect everything to
            work perfectly or fixes to be immediate. If you'd like, you can
            report bugs on our
